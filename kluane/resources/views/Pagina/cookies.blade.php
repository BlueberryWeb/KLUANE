                   <p>
                        "Do Not Track" (DNT) is a concept promoted by US regulatory authorities, such as the US Federal Trade Commission, for the Internet sector with the aim of developing and implementing a mechanism that allows Internet users to control the tracking or tracing of their online activities on different websites through their browser settings. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry players, Internet browsers, technology companies and standards bodies to develop a DNT technology standard. Although some progress has been made, it has been limited. To date, no standard has been adopted. As such, KLUANE DRILLING LTD does not respond to "non-traceability" signals.
